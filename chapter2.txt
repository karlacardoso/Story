I'm learning right now simple past in English.
I'm difficult about ED sounds 
There are three sounds D, T  and ED
I learned a new trick 'TED IS DED'
start=> starTED
need => NeeDED
Land=> lanDED
Teacher says to try prouncition sound D, if verb is past. If sound looks  weird, hard to speak,
try T, else try TED or DED. 
I liked this tips !
